# Clusters

This module called clusters do a simulation of multivariate normal distributions in n dimensions, this with the objective of training non supervised clustering models and vnd learn how this models work in an optimal way

## Requirements

```python
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import plotly.graph_objs as go
  import plotly.express as px
  import pandas as pd
  ```

## Changes history
#### V0.1 Realese 
includes the generate samples method to simulate random multivariate normal distributions, 2 methods for ploting in 2D and 3D, and a retrieval method of the data as a pandas df
